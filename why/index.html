   <h2>Why using Semanta Modeler?</h2>
   <p>
   Using Semanta Modeler gives you a great (database) modeling solution based on
   the concepts of semantic modeling. Data models created in Semanta Modeler are
   far more readable than data models drawn with ER based tools.
   </p>
   <p>
   Having years of experience in designing database models, we know that a lot of
   databases don't even have an ER model, and even when there are, they are very
   difficult to understand in a short time. ER models have to be studied very, very
   hard to understand them. When drawing the database model in Semanta Modeler you
   will be able to understand it very quickly. Or even better: recognize its design
   flaws and get to a better design.
   </p>
   <p>
   Semanta Modeler has been built from our years of experience in designing databases
   (both relational and non-relational). It is primarily aimed at modeling (relational-)
   databases, though the same concept can be used to build models of data structures
   of any kind (internal class models, system components or non-IT structures like
   organization hierarchies).
   </p>
   <p>
   To aid you in development of relational databases, it brings you powerful tools
   to translate the semantic model to the target database:
    <ul>
      <li>
      A powerful SQL database script generator to create your database from
      scratch or migrate your database between model versions. The script
      generator supports the industry standards in databases like Oracle
      and Microsoft SQL server. In addition, it comes with support for MySQL,
      PostgreSQL and Interbase.
      </li>
      <li>
      Reverse engineer an existing relational database into a Semantic model.
      </i>
      <li>Close interaction with development tools like Microsoft EntityFramework:
      it will generate the C# (Code First) classes required for the designed database,
      using all available metadata from the designed model. The resulting classes
      will be far more friendly to use when compared to using Database first in
      Visual Studio (import EDMX).
      </li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
   The Semantic modeling techniques have been development (and promoted) by
   dr.ir. J.H. (Johan) ter Bekke at the technical university in Delft, the
   Netherlands. He developed a prototype of a true Semantic database known
   as Xplain.
